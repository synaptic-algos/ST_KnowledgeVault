## Next Steps

1. **Set up issue tracking workflow**:
   - Train team on issue creation process
   - Establish triage schedule (daily/weekly)
   - Define escalation path for critical issues

2. **Integrate with existing workflow**:
   - Link to pilot-synaptictrading/issues for legacy issues
   - Migrate critical unresolved issues
   - Archive obsolete issues

3. **Establish metrics**:
   - Track resolution time
   - Identify recurring issue patterns
   - Monitor issue creation rate per sprint
