# Synaptic Trading Platform – User Manual

This manual grows incrementally after every sprint/epic so traders, quants, and analysts always have an up-to-date reference for what shipped. Each section links to deeper topic pages you can expand as features mature.

## Contents
- [Getting Started](./getting_started.md)
- [Navigation & Vault Explorer](./navigation.md)
- [Status Dashboards](./dashboards.md)
- [Strategy Governance & Prioritisation](./strategy_governance.md) ⭐ NEW
- [Partner Workspace](./partner_workspace.md)
- [Release Notes](./release_notes.md)

> Sprint Expectation: if a feature impacts end users, update the relevant section (or add a new page) before closing the sprint. Log the sprint ID and date inside `release_notes.md`.
